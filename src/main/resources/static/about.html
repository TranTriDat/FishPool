    <h1> General Behavior of the fish</h1>

    <p>
        Each fish has a current x-value and a current y-value. Every time the canvas page re-renders, which occurs 60 times a second
        that current x-value and y-value are updated:
    </br>

            -image of general behavior-

    </br>
        Each fish is initialized with a dx and dy value, which are essentially the change in X and the change in Y every time the fish are re-rendered. </br>


        In order to produce the wave-like behavior seen in fish movement, I first calculate the normal vector of the fishes current direction vector </br>
        Then, I make a variable called 'oscillation', which oscillates between 0.4 and -0.4 using a sinusoidal wave. </br>
        While updating the fish's x and y values with dx and dy, I add oscillation times the corresponding component of the normal vector. </br>
        
        The result of this is the fish moving in a set direction, while oscillating perpindicular to that direction. </br>

        However, fish in real life rarely move in a set direction for very long, so I had to include a degree of randomness to their motion.</br>

        This is implemented by multiplying dx and dy by a coefficient, representing the degree of randomness, by a random value between -0.5 and 0.5 (Math.random() - 0.5) </br>

        The most complex part about this project was not actually determining where the fish should be, but rather how it should be rendered </br>
